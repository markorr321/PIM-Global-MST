## 🔐 Permissions

When you run the tool for the first time, Microsoft will prompt you to sign in and approve access to Microsoft Graph permissions:

| Permission | Why It's Needed |
|------------|----------------|
| User.Read | To identify you and sign in securely |
| GroupMember.Read.All | To read group-based PIM role eligibilities |
| RoleManagement.Read.Directory | To view which PIM roles you're eligible for |
| RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory | To activate/deactivate eligible roles on your behalf |
| Directory.Read.All | To read directory information for role operations |

📌 These permissions are **delegated** meaning they only apply while you're signed in interactively using MFA.

👉 If you're the first person in your tenant to use the tool, Microsoft Entra may ask your admin to approve the requested permissions. This is a one-time step built into the Microsoft sign-in experience – no separate setup or consent URL is needed.

## 📩 Microsoft Teams Approval Workflow

In addition to the in-terminal role activation process, requests can also be handled through Microsoft Teams for a more collaborative and transparent approval process.  
This workflow leverages **Teams channels**, **Adaptive Cards**, and built-in approval notifications to streamline role activation, making it easy for managers and requestors to track the status without leaving Teams.

## 🛑 Deactivation Workflow

### **Intelligent Role Deactivation**
PIM-Global-MST automatically detects active roles and provides a streamlined deactivation process:

### **Key Features**
- **🔍 Active Role Detection** - Automatically scans and identifies currently active PIM roles
- **📋 Bulk Deactivation** - Deactivate multiple active roles simultaneously  
- **📝 Justification Tracking** - Required justification for all deactivation actions
- **📱 Teams Notifications** - Sends deactivation notifications to configured Teams channels
- **🔄 Session Continuity** - Deactivate roles without re-authentication in the same session

### **Deactivation Process**
1. **Launch the tool** - Run `PIM-Global-MST.exe` or the PowerShell script
2. **Authentication** - Complete MFA authentication (one-time per session)
3. **Active Role Detection** - Tool automatically scans for active PIM role assignments
4. **Role Selection** - Choose which active roles to deactivate (supports multi-select)
5. **Justification** - Provide reason for deactivation (required for audit compliance)
6. **Confirmation** - Review selections and confirm deactivation
7. **Teams Notification** - Automatic notification sent to configured Teams channels

### **Deactivation Workflow Benefits**
- **🛡️ Security Compliance** - Ensures roles are deactivated when no longer needed
- **📊 Audit Trail** - Complete justification and timestamp logging
- **⏱️ Time Savings** - Bulk operations reduce administrative overhead  
- **🔔 Transparency** - Teams notifications keep stakeholders informed
- **🎯 Precision** - Only shows roles that can actually be deactivated

### **Example Deactivation Scenario**
```
🔍 Detected Active Roles:
[1] Global Administrator (Expires: 2025-01-15 3:00 PM)
[2] Security Administrator (Expires: 2025-01-15 5:30 PM)
[3] User Administrator (Expires: 2025-01-15 4:15 PM)
